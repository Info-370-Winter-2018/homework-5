Loading data
```{r}
library(statisticalModeling)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
require(broom)
load("data_sim1.Rda")
data_sim1


library(statisticalModeling)

## Basic fitting of a model using R and tidyverse packages
Let's start by fitting a linear model using the built in package.

```{r}

#fit a linear model for y using x
# linear_model <- lm ( ? )
linear_model <- lm ( y ~x, data=data_sim1)
summary(linear_model)

# get the coefficients from the model
# tidy is a trick to make the model object from lm into a data frame
#   makes it easier to extract parts of it
#   -> you can access them with paramters[1] to get the intercept, [2] for the slope
parameters = tidy(linear_model)$estimate

# calculate the predictions from the lm model and add them to the data_sim1
# remember that the equation of a line is y = intercept + slope*x
# uncomment these lines and fix as needed
 data_sim1 <- data_sim1 %>%
  mutate(
    linear_model_prediction = parameters[1] + parameters[2]*x
  )
 
 data_sim1

```
## Tidy modeling with broom

You added the predictions above manually.
Packages like broom help you add predictions automatically. This is similar to some of the packages in the Datacamp course, but those packages in the statisticalModeling library aren't well-maintained / lack some flexibility (even though they are very good). People use broom more in practice.
```{r}
# use broom package to add predicted values to our dataset from the model
# (called .fitted ; same as model_output for )
# other values are added too like .residual = actual-.fitted
data_with_model_output <- augment(linear_model, data=data_sim1)
data_with_model_output
data_sim1
#let's plot the data and the prediction
# do this for data_sim1 then data_with_model_output 
#    to check these methods are equivalent
data_sim1_plot <- ggplot(data_sim1, aes(x)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y=x), size = 3, colour = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(y=y), size = 2, colour = "grey30")

data_sim1_plot


dwmo_plot <- ggplot(data_with_model_output, aes(x)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y=x), size = 3, colour = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(y=y), size = 2, colour = "grey30")

dwmo_plot

# hint: make the first layer have the predictions with larger sized points
#     so the actual data can be put on top of it 
ggplot( data_with_model_output , aes(x)) +
   geom_point(aes(y= x), size = 3, colour = "red") +
   geom_point(aes(y= y), size = 2, colour = "grey30")

```
Do you think this is a good model for the data set? Why?
  I think it is a good model because it clearly shows the relationship between the variables. 

What information would help you answer the question above better?
  The axis should be labeled, there should be a title, and a legend inidcating what the different colors and sizes mean. 
  
# Does faculty salary vary by gender and/or rank?

(modified from assignment from Mike Freeman's INFO370 class)

Let's begin by reading in some data from [this course website](http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/#salary). Columns included are:
    
    - **sx** = Sex, coded 1 for female and 0 for male
    - **rk** = Rank, coded
        - 1 for assistant professor,
        - 2 for associate professor, and
        - 3 for full professor
    - **yr** = Number of years in current rank
    - **dg** = Highest degree, coded 1 if doctorate, 0 if masters
    - **yd** = Number of years since highest degree was earned
    - **sl** = Academic year salary, in dollars.
```{r}
library(readr)
faculty <- read_table(url("http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/salary.dat"))
glimpse(faculty)

```
## Descriptive statistics by gender
Before doing any modeling, you should get a basic feel for the gender breakdown in your dataset.
 
Write code for each of the below:
```{r}
# What is the number of males/females in the dataset? What does this already tell you...?
summary(faculty$sx == "male")
summary(faculty$sx == "female")

#this already tells me that there are almost three times the amount of male professors than female professors

# What is the mean salary by sex? Hint: you'll have to groupby sex (`sx`)
faculty %%
  group_by('sx') %% 
  ## count('sl') %%
  summarise(mean = mean(sl), n=n())

# this doesn't work and i am not sure how to solve it, this is my struggle. I have looked on stack overflow and it is not helpful :/

# Draw histograms for the distribution of salaries for males and females (separately)
# Hint: you can use ggplot and facet 
# The x and y axes should be consistent between the graphs
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("plotly")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)


fsalary <- ggplot(faculty, aes(x=sl, y=sl)) + geom_point(shape=1)
msalary<- gpplot(faculty, aes(x=sl, y=sl)) + 
  geom_point(shape=1)


# Draw histograms for the distribution of salaries by rank
faculty
g <- ggplot(faculty, aes(sl, fill=rk))
g + geom_histogram(binwidth=300)

# Create scatterplots to show how salary compares to years since degree / in current rank
ggplot(faculty, aes(x=yd, y=sl)) + geom_point() 

# Create plots of salary (by gender) for each rank
ggplot(faculty, aes(x=sl, y=sx)) + geom_point() 

# What do these tell you about gender discrimination on the faculty?
# It is clear through this data set that males are paid much higher salaries on average and that there are also more males in this career field than females.
## Simple linear regression: what is the salary increase associated with each additional year in your current position (yr)?

```{r}
# Create a simple linear model that assesses the relationship between 
# years in current position with salary
salary_by_exp <- lm(yr ~ sl, faculty)
fmodel(salary_by_exp)
# What is the effect size of years on salary? Also interpret the effect size in words.
# Hint: you can use tools from statisticalModeling package used in the Datacamp course
library(statisticalModeling)
library(rpart)
model_1 <- data.class(model.frame(sl ~ yr, data = faculty))

##model_1 <- rpart(faculty ~ sl + yr, 
                ## data = faculty, cp = 0.001)
## I almost have the training figured out, but idk what to put in for faculty (the first one)
effect_size(model_1, ~ yr)

#I keep getting the error that 
 # no applicable method for 'explanatory_vars' applied to an object of class "character"
#I am not sure how to fix this... I have googled and looked back at data camp and looked at documentation
# Evaluate the accuracy of your model. Calculate a metric for it.

hist(faculty$sl)
sqrt(effect_size(faculty ~ yr)) 

# Interpret the metric for accuracy above.
summary(salary_by_exp)

# Draw a scatterplot with your model on it to show how well the model fits the data
# Hint: broom and ggplot may be useful here

install.packages("broom")
library(broom)
ggplot(salary_by_exp, aes(x=yr, y=sl)) + geom_point() 



```
## Multiple Regression
Predict using multiple independent variables

```{r}
# Using multiple regression, create a linear model that uses 
# sex, rank, and years in current rank variables to estimate salary
library(mosaic)
model_1 <- lm(sl ~ sx + yr + rk, faculty)
plot(model_1)

# What is the effect size for each variable in the model? Also interpret the effect size in words.
effectsize1 <- mod_effect(model_1, ~sx) # change = 524.1492
effectsize2 <- mod_effect(model_1, ~rk) # change = -9483.842
effectsize3 <- mod_effect(model_1, ~yr) # change = 390.9358


# Write what surprises you....
# The fact that rank's effect size was so low and the others were so high was surprising. other than that, I am shocked to see that effect size is bigger for sex that it is for years... 


# Create a new dataset with your multiple regression model's predictions in a new column
model_2 <- 
cbind(model_1, resid=resid(es1), fitted=fitted(effectsize1))
# I'm not sure how to do this :(

# How do the new model's predictions compare to the simpler model's predictions?
# Make plots and then write below
mod_plot(model_1)
mod_plot(model_2)

# It shows a lot more detail that there are other factors that will interact with salary. There are multiple explanatory variables. 


# Create a scatter plot with years since degree on the x axis, and salary on the y axis. Show points for both the data, and the multiple regression values.
# Bonus points: improve the visualization above by adding more variables
ggplot(faculty, aes(x=yd, y=sl)) + geom_point(x=effectsize1) 

```
## Assess predictions

```{r}
# Make a scatterplot that compares the data (x) to the predictions (y)
# X is referring to years in current position
ggplot(faculty,  aes(x=yr, y=pr)) + geom_point() 

# Add a line showing where the perfect values would be (i.e., prediction equal to data)
ggplot(data=faculty, aes(rnorm)) 

# What are the MSE values of the two models?
mod_error(model1)
mod_error(model2)

# Which one explains more variance?
#The second one, model 2

# Plot the salary v.s. the *residuals* (difference between actual and predicted values)
# Create a separate (adjacent) plot for each model
# Add a horizontal line at 0 to help interpret the graph
# or use the ggplot resources in #help on slack to make a better residuals plot
# ie
# http://shinyapps.org/apps/RGraphCompendium/index.php
# http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
ggplot(faculty, aes(x=yr, y=sl)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
ggplot(faculty, aes(x=0, y=sl)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)


# Provide an interpretation for these graphs
#  It is clear that multiple variables will effect salary, beyond sex. However, sex does play an important role in the salary of professors, even more so than the experience in the role. 
```
